Everyone loves pancakes! Here's a foolproof recipe for light, fluffy pancakes to start your day off right.

## Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 3 ½ tsp baking powder
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- 1 egg
- 3 tbsp melted butter

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and sugar.
2. In a separate bowl, mix the milk, egg, and melted butter.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this will result in dense pancakes.
4. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
5. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately ¼ cup for each pancake.
6. Cook each side until golden brown. Serve hot with syrup, berries, or whipped cream!

Tip: For extra fluffy pancakes, let the butter rest for 5 minutes before cooking.
