Yoga is a wonderful practice that combines physical movement with mental clarity. If you're a beginner, starting with basic poses can help you ease into the practice while reaping the benefits of increased flexibility, strength, and focus.

### Top 10 Yoga Poses for Beginners

1. **Mountain Pose (Tadasana)**  
This foundational pose helps improve posture and alignment. Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart, arms at your sides, and engage your core.

2. **Downward Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)**  
A great pose for stretching the hamstrings and calves while strengthening the arms and shoulders.

3. **Tree Pose (Vrksasana)**  
A balance pose that helps improve focus and strengthen the legs. Stand on one leg, placing the sole of the other foot on your inner thigh.
